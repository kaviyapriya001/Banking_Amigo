        <h4 class="about-us-heading">Who are we?</h4>
        <div class="about-us-text">We are five students studying Computer Science and Engineering at Bannari Amman Institute of Technology. We like creating apps and learning about the hottest personal finance trends.</div>
        <div class="about-us-text">We created Banking Amigo to help young girls from age 10 to 17 with starting their personal financial journey.  We believe it is important to develop good financial habits from a young age. It is alright to learn and make mistakes when the risks are small so that you will have learned from those lessons and have become an expert in personal finance in the future!</div>
        <h4 class="about-us-heading">Motives and Intensions</h4>
        <div class="about-us-text">When we were teenagers, we were overwhelmed with all the different banks, accounts and didn't know where to start. We wish we had a friend that could help us walk through some of the confusing banking terms, provide us with easy-to-follow tips to guide us. This is exactly what we want to accomplish with Banking Amigo. Tailored towards young girls who have zero or very limited knowledge about finance, our amigo Helen take them through interactive scenarios of choosing a bank, bank accounts, and spending and saving their money. </div>
