## Inspiration âœ¨

When we were teenagers, we were overwhelmed with all the different banks, accounts and didn't know where to start. We wish we had a friend that could help us walk through some of the confusing banking terms, provide us with easy-to-follow tips to guide us.

And we are not alone in feeling this way.

Financial literacy is globally recognized as an [essential life skill](https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/pisa-2015-results-volume-iv_9789264270282-en;jsessionid=e9NkhlsApFk8Pmw38RWJX2eZ.ip-10-240-5-30). But, only [One in seven students](https://www.oecd.org/daf/fin/financial-education/many-15-year-olds-struggle-with-financial-literacy-according-to-oecd-pisa-report.htm) in many modern countries are unable to make even simple decisions on everyday spending. Kids and teenagers are not properly introduced to financial concepts through [formal education](https://youth.gov/youth-topics/financial-capability-literacy/facts#_ftn3). A [majority of teens want to learn about finance](https://youth.gov/youth-topics/financial-capability-literacy/facts#_ftn3), but find current methods difficult to navigate.

This is exactly what we want to accomplish with Finance Bestie.
